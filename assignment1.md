# Data-Driven Investigation Critique

# Pitch

* Question: What is the extent of solitary confinement in the United States? How many individuals are currently in solitary confinement? How long do they spend in solitary?
* Data: According to Solitary Watch, Americans are held in federal, state and territorial prison systems; local jails; and immigration, military, tribal, civil commitment, psychiatric and juvenile detention facilities. While solitary confinement is not always tracked, when it is, it often appears under various names.
* Timeliness: President Joe Biden promised on the campaign trail to restrict the use of solitary confinement but has not followed through on the issue. Recently, the ACLU and other organizations sent a letter to Biden emphasizing the need to limit the use of solitary.
* Sources: Solitary Watch (a non-profit that focuses on solitary confinement, have noted the lack of usable data in this area), ACLU, lawmakers working on criminal justice/civil rights issues, groups that oppose ending solitary
* Anything Else: I wrote a couple of articles on solitary confinement last quarter and would love to approach this issue from a different angle.
