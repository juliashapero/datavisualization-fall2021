# Data-Driven Investigation Critique

## Clarity and Accuracy

* 5 = I was immediately able to identify the central insight of the article. The central insight of the article was that an intelligence-based policing program in Pasco County led to the targeted harrassment of residents, particularly minors. This central insight was mostly in the headline; however, the program's impact on minors became more clear within the article itself.
* N/A = There was no data visualization in this article. 
* 4 = I believe that the data is mostly accurate. The Tampa Bay Times provided access to some of the bodycam footage and the documents used in its research for the article, which increased my trust in the data. However, some of its data felt more like guesswork. In order to determine the portion of arrests that were teenagers, the Tampa Bay Times performed its own series of calculations since it couldn't obtain a list. There is the possibility that the data is accurate, but, even so, the confusing explanation used in the article casts doubt over its accuracy. Since this was a key point of the article, I found this lack of clarity to be concerning. Despite this, all of the information in the article appears to be well-sourced. I particularly liked the use of sources who had worked within the police department because it increased my trust in the accuracy of the information as it came from the other side.

## Quality

* 5 = The article was executed with a high degree of quality. It was well-written, telling a compelling story both through anecdotes and data. Additionally, the combination of feature photos of those who said they were targeted by the policing program and stills from bodycam footage create an interesting visual aspect to the story and increase the reader's trust in the individuals' stories. I think the main thing that could have improved upon the story would have been graphics that visualized some of the data.  

## Type and Color

* N/A = The article does not include graphics.

## Creativity

* 4 = I think the article did a fairly good job of using creative elements. As noted above, I liked the use of both feature photos as a visually appealling and emotionally compelling element to the article and stills from bodycam footage as a reinforcement of the individuals' stories. However, as I also said under quality, the story could have benefited from the addition of graphics to visualize data. I think the article could also have been improved by a different design. In a separate story, the Tampa Bay Times examined the body footage in a very interesting manner that I found very visually appealing. As you scroll, different blurbs of text or video pop up which helps center your attention on them. I think it could have been interesting to present portions of the story in this manner, as is often done in other publications. The videos of police enocunters would have also reinforced the sources' stories. 

# Pitch

* Question: What is the extent of solitary confinement in the United States? How many individuals are currently in solitary confinement? How long do they spend in solitary?
* Data: According to Solitary Watch, Americans are held in federal, state and territorial prison systems; local jails; and immigration, military, tribal, civil commitment, psychiatric and juvenile detention facilities. While solitary confinement is not always tracked, when it is, it often appears under various names.
* Timeliness: President Joe Biden promised on the campaign trail to restrict the use of solitary confinement but has not followed through on the issue. Recently, the ACLU and other organizations sent a letter to Biden emphasizing the need to limit the use of solitary.
* Sources: Solitary Watch (a non-profit that focuses on solitary confinement, have noted the lack of usable data in this area), ACLU, lawmakers working on criminal justice/civil rights issues, groups that oppose ending solitary
* Anything Else: I wrote a couple of articles on solitary confinement last quarter and would love to approach this issue from a different angle.
